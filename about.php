				<h2 class="sectionheader">Here is a bit about me:</h2>
				<p>I am Frank van Boheemen, I live in Amsterdam,  I have an healthy obsession for technology and I like making stuff.</p>
				<p>My journey started with studying Architecture. Here I learned to see the opportunities of design, along with everything about form, composition, construction and materials. Now, after Architecture, I study Design for Interaction to learn about users, user testing and user-focused design.</p>
				<p>I have a preference for minimalistic and honest design with a lot of focus on detailing.</p>
				<p>And i really love music and coffee too.</p>
